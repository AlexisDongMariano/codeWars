## Beginner Series #3 Sum of Numbers ##
# Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, 
# find the sum of all the numbers between including them too 
# and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.
def get_sum(a,b):
    ans = 0
    if a == b:
        return a
    if a < b:
        for x in range(a, b + 1):
            ans += x
    else:
        for x in (range(b, a + 1)):
            ans += x

 def get_sum(a,b):
    return sum(range(min(a,b), max(a,b)+1))
