def count(string):
    out = {}
    for i in string:
        if i not in out.keys():
            out[i] = 1;
        else:
            out[i] = out.get(i) + 1
    return out
    
# *other solution:
from collections import Counter

def count(string):
    return Counter(string)
    
# *other solution:
def count(string):
    counter = {}
    for char in string:
        counter[char] = counter.get(char, 0) + 1
    return counter

# *other solutions:
def count(string):
    return {ch: string.count(ch) for ch in string}
